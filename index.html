      <p>My favorite character is Ron weasley.The weasleys are important beacuse of Ron(who is Harry's best friend) and for Arthur Weasley
the only dad character in the Harry Potter series.I like Ron because this is the only practical character in the Harry Potter series(other characters like Harry,Dombledore,hermione are not like a normal people) I like him because of his sence of humor and he also plays a main role Harry Potter.</p>

     <p>I liked him the most when he breaks his wand and his wand either porforms half the magic, like it does when he tries to transform a rat into a goblet and it turns into a goblet with fur and a alive tail, or backfires ,like it does when he tries a trick that will make people vomit slugs on Malfoy and he starts to vomit slugs!</p>

<br>
Ron possesses the confidence of being a child deeply loved. Unlike Harry, he has no financial means. His father is a highly ranked member of the Ministry of Magic and his family is backed by generations of pure wizard blood, but Ron is often picked on by Malfoy for wearing tattered robes, for living in an old house, and for not having a rich father. Ron's poverty is a source of great insecurity for him, and he often responds to these taunts with violent, angry reactions. His attempts to respond using his wand often fail. He casts ill- conjured and often reversing spells. Ron is deeply loyal to the people he loves, including his family, Harry, and Hermione. He defends them with brutish desperation. He and Harry are inseparable, and Ron is often perceived as a sidekick of the famous Harry Potter. Ron feels valued by Harry and doesn't seem to mind this on a regular basis, although in spurts he seems to feel deflated and glossed over. He is adventurous, like Harry, and somewhat mischievous. He always has good intentions.</p>

          My inspiration is Jk rowling the author of Harry potter series.She is my inspiration because of the connectivity in her books like harry poter book-7 is linked with book-1.
          Her books also contains twists that make the story very interesting.
              <br>
              During one fine morning in 1990, when she was on a train ride from Manchester to London, she formed the entire story from an idea and started developing the story of Harry Potter on that journey. Unfortunately, her mother died later that year which halted her writing process for some time.Actuall J.K. Rowling's pitch for 'Harry Potter' was rejected 12 times.Now it is one of the most read books anth best book for chldren to read.Anyone who has read the books knows – courage is one of the central themes of Harry Potter's story. And bravery not just by him, but his parents, his friends and his allies – they all make the story so very brilliant. The books teach us that it is often difficult to muster courage.<br>
          J.K Rowling took six years to write Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the first book in the Harry Potter series. It was published on 26 June, 1997 and the bestselling fantasy novel series is marking its 20th anniversary in 2017.</p>

          <p>Ronald Bilius Weasley is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter fantasy novel series. His first appearance was in the first book of the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as the best friend of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. He is a member of the Weasley family, a pure blood family that resides in "The Burrow" outside Ottery St. Catchpole. Being the only member of the three main characters raised in magical society, he also provides insight into the Wizarding World's magical customs and traditions. Along with Harry and Hermione, he is a member of Gryffindor house and is present for most of the action throughout the series.<br>Rowling introduces Ron as "tall, thin and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose."[PS Ch.6] Ron has the trademark red hair of the Weasleys and is indeed one of Harry's tallest schoolmates, even outgrowing some of his older brothers. Rowling states in the novels that Ron has freckles, though Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron, has none. Rowling has also stated that Ron has blue eyes.<br>Ron is known for his humor, loyalty, readiness to defend his friends and his love for sweets. Rowling in an interview described Ron as very funny but insensitive and immature, saying "There's a lot of immaturity about Ron, and that's where a lot of the humor comes from.></p>
